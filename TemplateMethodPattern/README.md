# Template Method Pattern

The Template Method Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, allowing subclasses to override specific steps without changing the overall algorithm structure. This promotes code reuse and enforces a consistent process while enabling flexibility for individual steps.

**MISTAKE**

- I accidentally stagged all the files I made changes to before making the "init project git" commit

- so I used the "git restore --staged ." command to unstage all the files.
